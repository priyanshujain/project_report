\chapter{Conclusion}

To summarize, we have learned about all the existing
systems which included ELIZA. We found
out ways in which these systems can influence our system.
ELIZA helped us understand how reframing the questions
will make the conversations more human-like. We decided
to build a system to implement natural language processing
on CLI(command line interface). In this system, the user will be prompted to
ask a query which is related to daily life. The user will text out
his query using the command line. A range
of related questions and their responses will be coded
and stored into the dataset. When the user will
ask a query, this query will be matched against the various
patterns present in the dataset and the template
corresponding to that pattern will be returned in form of
text to the user.
