Chatbots are computer programs that interact
with users using natural languages. Just as people use language
for human communication, chatbots use natural language to
communicate with human users. In this project, we begin by
introducing chatbots and emphasize their need in day-to-day
activities. Then we go on to discuss existing chatbot systems,
namely ELIZA. We evaluate what we can take
from each of the systems and use in our proposed system.
Finally, we discuss the proposed system. The system we intend
to develop can be used for single human chatting. The
database will be fed with related data which will be
coded using Python. My implementation is based on one originally written by Joe Strout. I have updated it significantly to use a more modern and idiomatic form of Python This system can be used in operating systems in a similar manner to Siri for effective information retrieval just by telling various queries.\\
